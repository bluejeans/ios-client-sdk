## Version 1.6.0
---------------------------------

### ðŸš¨ ***Breaking Changes*** 
- meetingService.audioMuted type changed from Bool? -> Bool
- meetingService.videoMuted type changed from Bool? -> Bool
- meetingService.audioMuteState type changed from MuteState? -> MuteState
- meetingService.videoMuteState type changed from MuteState? -> MuteState

meetingService.setAudioMuted, and meetingService.setVideoMuted may now be set prior to joining a meeting,
or while in the waiting room. Any updates to the localMuted state will retained while the SDK is in memory.

This will only ever be set locally and can be ignored if not using custom layout controls.

### New License
See the updated LICENSE.txt

### Added
#### Individual Stream Control
- Create custom layouts and request specific streams of video using the `VideoStreamService`
- Set the VideoLayout to `.custom`
- Request streams of video with the `setVideoStreamConfiguration` 
- Observe active streams of video with the `videoStreams` array
- Render videos in your own custom sized views with `attachParticipantStreamToView`
- See the `VideoStreamService` for all additions

#### ParticipantsService Additions
- participantsService.getParticipantWithId(id: String) -> BJNParticipant?

## Version 1.5.0
---------------------------------
### Added
- meetingService.contentMuted - reflects the enablement of the content stream
- meetingService.remoteAudioMuted - reflects the enablement of remote audio streams
- meetingService.remoteVideoMuted - reflects the enablement of remote video streams

- audioDeviceService.audioSessionActive - tracks if the AVAudioSession is managed by the SDK. If active, other in-app sounds should be played through the supplied SDK methods. This value can also be observed to know when the SDK audio session is completely cleaned up after leaving a meeting.
- BJNObservable.publisher - a Combine framework publisher that publishes the initial value, then a new value on every change of the observable. 

### Fixed
